        <p><em>Donor Relations Coordinator</em></p>
        <p>I am a recent graduate from Milwaukee Area Technical College where I earned an Associate Degree in Liberal Arts. Currently working as the Donor Relations Coordinator at the Jewish Home and Care Center Foundation, I am beginning my Bachelor Degree in UX at Mount Mary University this fall. In my free time, I enjoy crafting, learning new skills, and catching up on sitcoms.</p>
